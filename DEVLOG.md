## [2026-03-07] v0.1 shipped — blog posts, roadmap, and gitignore cleanup

**Category:** `milestone`
**Tags:** `launch`, `content`, `roadmap`, `v0.1`

### Summary
Completed the v0.1 feature set for claude-dev-team: five personas, coordinator layer, bash 3.2-compatible CLI, and installer. Added a PMM-voice blog post series and a product roadmap to the README.

### Detail
- Five team member personas shipped: Robin (QA/Testing), Akira (Backend), Sasha (Frontend), Toni (Product Marketing), River (Product)
- Coordinator layer added as a separate CLAUDE.md block — survives team member switches, suggests team member + operating mode (Plan / Ask before edits / Edit automatically) at task start and on domain shifts
- Fixed bash 3.2 compatibility (macOS ships bash 3.2; removed `${var^}` and `${var,,}` in favor of `awk`/`tr` helpers)
- Fixed wildcard bug in `cmd_list` where empty `$active` matched every team member
- Fixed coordinator appearing in `claude-team list` output
- Wrote five blog posts in Toni's PMM voice (benefit-first, audience-obsessed, outcome-focused) — one per team member, stored in `claude-dev-team-blog-posts.md` outside the repo
- Added roadmap to README covering: v0.1 current state, v0.2 slash command shortcuts (`/robin`, `/sasha-plan`, etc. via `.claude/commands/`), and v0.3+ backlog
- Added `claude-dev-team-blog-posts.md` to `.gitignore` (draft content, not repo)
